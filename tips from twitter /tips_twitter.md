Here’s my last finding (P1)
1- register account
2- intercept request
3- here’s the response in image so in “role” parameter we have ROLE_USER
So i don’t know what i can replace it to privilege my account to admin
4- open source code and look in js files
5-So in js files i user ctrl+F to search about “user_role” i found another value that’s called “admin_role”
6- so i use match and replace to replace value’s
7- boom privilege my account to admin account with full control

[ ] Tip 31
if a site uses AngularJS,
```
test {{7*7}} to see whether 49 is rendered anywhere.
If the application is built with ASP.NET with XSS protection
enabled, you might want to focus on testing other vulnerability
types first and check for XSS as a last resort.

```

[ ] Tip 32
If a site is built with Rails,
```
you might know that URLs typically follow a /CONTENT_TYPE/RECORD_ID pattern, where the
RECORD_ID is an autoincremented integer. Using HackerOne as an example, report URLs follow the pattern
www.hackerone.com/reports/12345. Rails applications commonly use integer IDs, so you might prioritize testing
insecure direct object reference vulnerabilities because this vulnerability type is easy for developers to overlook.

Try these file-uploading extensions accordingly.

ASP Applications:

.asa -> potential remote code execution

.asax -> potential remote code execution

.asp -> potential remote code execution

.aspx -> potential remote code execution

Java Applications: 

.jsp -> potential remote code execution

.jspx -> potential remote code execution

Perl Applications: 

.pl -> potential remote code execution

Python Applications: 

.py -> potential remote code execution

Ruby Applications:

.rb -> potential remote code execution

Other files that should be restricted for most applications: 

.bat
.cgi
.exe
.htm -> potential XSS
.html -> potential XSS
.jar
.rar
.shtml
.svg -> potential XSS
.swf -> potential XSS
.tar
.zip
.cer -> potential XSS
.hxt -> potential XSS
.stm -> potential XSS
